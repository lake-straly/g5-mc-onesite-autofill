This tool will automatically fill out the G5 Integrations Dashboard with Marketing Center / OneSite information. All you need to do is provide the Lease Star Company ID, and click the bookmarklet. This tool scrapes the JSON that is returned when you make an API call to https://api.myleasestar.com/ and parses that information, then fills it into the relevant fields. All from the safetey of our good 'ol integrations dashboard. 
<br>
<br>This tool operates off of an exact name match, so if the name that is returned from the API call doesn't match exactly what we have in the G5 integration dashboard, then it won't place the codes. 
<br>
<br>I _did_ have the username and password automatically fill out, but due to the public nature of this file I omitted those fields. I did however leave the variables there, so if you want to add them go right ahead. I also left a field in there for it to automatically add a "MM/DD/YYYY NAME - Created" note.
<br>After this tool finishes placing the codes it will highlight all of the empty fields in yellow.
<br>You may have to open the "chrome://bookmarks" page and add it there. There seems to be a character limit if you just right-click the bookmarks bar and attempt to add it there.<br>
<br>
<br>Please reach out with any feature requests, or bugs you find!
