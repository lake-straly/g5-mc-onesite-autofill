This tool will automatically fill out the G5 Integrations Dashboard with Marketing Center / OneSite information. All you need to do is provide the Lease Star Company ID, and click the bookmarklet. This tool scrapes the JSON that is returned when you make an API call to https://api.myleasestar.com/ and parses that information, then fills it into the relevant fields. All from the safetey of our good 'ol integrations dashboard. 
<br>
<br>This tool works off of name-matching. If it detects an exact name match, it will place the IDs for your location without prompting the user. If if finds a similar name, it will prompt the user for verification before placing the IDs.
<br>
<br>I _did_ have the username and password automatically fill out, but due to the public nature of this file I omitted those fields. When you initially run this bookmarklet, it will prompt you for some information; your name, vendor username and vendor password. You only need to enter them once. It will store this information in a cookie on the integrations dashboard page. Your name is only used for automated note taking.
<br>
<br>After this tool finishes placing the codes it will highlight all of the empty fields in yellow.
<br>
<br>Please reach out with any feature requests, or bugs you find!
